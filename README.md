# System Engineering and DevOps - Bash, Scripting, Web Stack/Web Stack Debugging, Networking & Security

This repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps
track at Holberton School. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced
writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I learned about the OSI model and
various Linux networking tools. Further, I configured a web server using
Nginx. The specific list of projects contained follows:

  * [0x00. Shell, basics](0x00-shell_basics)
  * [0x01. Shell, permissions](0x01-shell_permissions)
  * [0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters](0x02-shell_redirections)
  * [0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions](0x03-shell_variables_expansions)
  * [0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing](0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing)
  * [0x05. Processes and signals](0x05-processes_and_signals)
