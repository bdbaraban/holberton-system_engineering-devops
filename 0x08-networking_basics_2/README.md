# Networking basics #1

This project was the second of two introducing networking. I continued to learn 
about IP addresses while practicing manipulating them with Bash scripts.

## Tasks

* **Localhost**
  * `0-localhost`: Text file that answers the following question:
  * What is `localhost`?
    1. A hostname that means this IP
    2. A hostname that means this computer
    3. An IP attached to a computer

* **All IPs**
  * `1-wildcard`: Text file that answers the following question:
  * What is `0.0.0.0`?
    1. All IPv4 addresses on the local machine
    2. All the IPs
    3. It means null in networking

* **Change your home IP**
  * `2-change_your_home_IP`: Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server as 
follows:
  * `localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.2`
  * `facebook.com` resolves to `8.8.8.8`

* **Show attached IPs**
  * `3-show_attached_IPs`: Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IP's on 
the machine.

* **Port listening on localhost**
  * `4-port_listening_on_localhost`: Bash script that listens on port `98` on 
`localhost`.
