# Shell, init files, variables and expansions

In this project, I learned about initialization files, local, global, and
reserved variables, and special parameters in the Shell. Further, I practiced
using expansions, performing arithmetic operations, and utilizing aliases.

  * [11-binary_to_decimal](./11-binary_to_decimal): Bash script that converts a number
  in base 2 stored in the environment variable `BINARY` to base 10.

* **12. Combination**
  * [12-combinations](./12-combinations): Bash script that prints all possible combinations
  of two letters, except `oo`, as follows:
    * Letters are lower cases, from `a` to `z`.
    * One combination per line.
    * Alpha-ordered.

* **13. Floats**
  * [13-print_float](./13-print_float): Bash script that prints a number stored in the
  environment variable `NUM` with two decimal places.

* **14. Decimal to Hexadecimal**
  * [14-decimal_to_hexadecimal](./14-decimal_to_hexadecimal): Bash script
  that converts a number in base 10 stored in the environment variable `DECIMAL` to base 16.

* **15. Everyone is a proponent of strong encryption**
  * [100-rot13](./100-rot13): Bash script that encodes and decodes text using the rot13
  encryption.
